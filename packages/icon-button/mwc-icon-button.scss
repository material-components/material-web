   * Any vertical-align other than the default of "baseline" will work here (and

   * In general, when an inline-block element has vertical-align: baseline and
   * also a fixed height, extra space may "appear" below it. This is because the
   * baseline it is aligned to is not the very bottom of the line, it's the line
   * above the "descenders" (e.g. the tail of a "y" or "j"). This means the
   * container must grow to accomodate both the fixed height inline-element, and
   * the descender height below it.
   *
   * For unknown reasons, in this particular case, this only causes incorrect
   * alignment in IE.
   *
   * IE needs the vertical-align on both the button and the host element.
