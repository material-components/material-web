<!-- [TOC] -->

Focus rings are accessible outlines for components to show keyboard focus.

Focus rings follow the same heuristics as
[`:focus-visible`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible)<!-- {.external} -->
to determine when they are visible.

## Usage

Focus rings display on keyboard navigation. They may be attached to a control in
one of three ways.

![An element with a focus ring.](images/focus/usage.gif "A focus ring.")

1.  Attached to the parent element

    ```html
    <button style="position: relative">
      <md-focus-ring style="--md-focus-ring-shape: 8px"></md-focus-ring>
    </button>
    ```

1.  Attached to a referenced element

    ```html
    <div style="position: relative">
      <md-focus-ring for="control" style="--md-focus-ring-shape: 8px"></md-focus-ring>
      <input id="control">
    </div>
    ```

1.  Attached imperatively

    ```html
    <div style="position: relative">
      <md-focus-ring id="ring" style="--md-focus-ring-shape: 8px"></md-focus-ring>
      <button id="ring-control"></button>
    </div>
    <script>
      const focusRing = document.querySelector('#ring');
      const control = document.querySelector('#ring-control');
      focusRing.attach(control);
    </script>
    ```

> Note: focus rings must be placed within a `position: relative` container.

### Inward

Focus rings can be changed to animate inwards by adding an `inward` attribute.
This is useful for components like list items.

![An element with a focus ring that animates inward.](images/focus/usage-inward.gif "A focus ring animating inward.")

```html
<button style="position: relative">
  <md-focus-ring inward style="--md-focus-ring-shape: 8px"></md-focus-ring>
</button>
```

### Animation

The focus ring animation may be customized or disabled using CSS custom
properties.

![An element with a focus ring that does not animate.](images/focus/usage-animation.gif "A focus ring with disabled animations.")

```html
<style>
  md-focus-ring {
    --md-focus-ring-duration: 0s; /* disabled animation */
  }
</style>
```

## Accessibility

Focus rings are visual components and do not have assistive technology
requirements.

## Theming

Focus rings supports [Material theming](../theming/README.md) and can be
customized in terms of color and shape.

### Tokens

Token                   | Default value
----------------------- | --------------------------
`--md-focus-ring-color` | `--md-sys-color-secondary`
`--md-focus-ring-shape` | `--md-sys-shape-corner-full`
`--md-focus-ring-width` | `3px`

*   [All tokens](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/blob/main/tokens/_md-comp-focus-ring.scss)
    <!-- {.external} -->

### Example

![Image of a focus ring with a different theme applied](images/focus/theming.gif "Focus ring theming example.")

```html
<style>
md-focus-ring {
  --md-focus-ring-shape: 0px;
  --md-focus-ring-width: 2px;
  --md-focus-ring-active-width: 4px;
  --md-sys-color-secondary: #4A6363;
}
</style>

<button>
  <md-focus-ring></md-focus-ring>
</button>
```
