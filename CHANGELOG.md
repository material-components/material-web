  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Material+Icons&display=block" rel="stylesheet">

  section of the README for more details.

## [0.9.1] - 2019-09-30

### Fixed

- Fixed missing `@material/mwc-base` dep on `@material/mwc-dialog`.

## [0.9.0] - 2019-09-26

### Added

- Implemented `mwc-dialog`
- `mwc-textfield.layout` method.

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Added custom `.focus()` and `.blur()` functions to mwc-button
  that cause the button to ripple as when tab focusing.
- **BREAKING:** mwc-textfield's custom `.focus()` function will now call
  `.focus()` on the native internal input causing the caret to appear instead of
  just forcing focus styles to appear.
- **BREAKING:** mwc-textfield's custom `.blur()` function will now call
  `.blur()` on the native internal input instead of just forcing focus styles to
  disapprear.
- **BREAKING** `mwc-base/base-element` no longer exports any of the
  `lit-element` or `lit-html` APIs (e.g. `LitElement`, `customElement`,
  `classMap`). Users should import directly from the `lit-element` and
  `lit-html` modules instead.
- **BREAKING** `mwc-textfield` and `mwc-textarea` will now update their `.value`
  on the native `input`'s `input` event instead of `change`.

  their filled and outlined variants with helper text on older browsers.

## [0.8.0] - 2019-09-03

### Changed

- Published JavaScript files no longer include inlined TypeScript helpers such
  as `__decorate`. Instead, helpers are now imported from the
  [`tslib`](https://github.com/microsoft/tslib) module dependency. This reduces
  code size by allowing multiple components to share the same helpers, and
  eliminates *"this has been rewritten to undefined"* errors from Rollup.
  ([#439](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/439))

- **BREAKING** Renamed component *`base`* modules:
  ([#440](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/440)):

    ([#355](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/355))
  - [`<mwc-top-app-bar>`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/tree/master/packages/top-app-bar)
    ([#379](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/379))

### Changed
- **BREAKING** The Material Icons font is no longer loaded automatically
  ([#314](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/314)).
  This allows more control over how fonts are loaded (e.g. serving fonts from a
  different server, or loading multiple fonts with a single request). Most users
  should now add tags like this to their HTML page:

  ```html
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500" rel="stylesheet">
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Material+Icons&display=block" rel="stylesheet">
  ```

- **BREAKING** The *toggling* behavior of `<mwc-icon-button>` has been removed
  (i.e. `offIcon`), and is now instead supported by the dedicated
  [`<mwc-icon-button-toggle>`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/tree/master/packages/icon-button-toggle)
  component
  ([#370](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/370)).


- **BREAKING** The *short* layout for `<mwc-top-app-bar>` has been removed, and
  is no longer supported because it is not part of the Material Design
  specification
  ([#422](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/422)).


- **BREAKING** The *fixed* layout for `<mwc-top-app-bar>` has been removed, and
  is now instead implemented by the dedicated `<mwc-top-app-bar-fixed>`
  component
  ([#379](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/379)).

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where `<mwc-snackbar>` `open` method threw if called immediately
  after construction (before `firstUpdated`)
  ([#356](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/356)).
- Fixed bug where setting the `<mwc-snackbar>` `labelText` property could throw
  an exception and fail to render
  ([#412](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/412)).
- Buttons slotted into `<mwc-snackbar>` now render with the correct default
  styles
  ([#354](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/354)).
- Fixed layout issue affecting scrolling `<mwc-tab-bar>` in Firefox
  ([#349](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/349)).
- Fixed bug where `<mwc-icon>` icons did not render in IE11
  ([#353](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/353)).
- Fixed bug where setting the `checked` property on an `<mwc-radio>` did not
  result in the other radios in the group becoming unchecked
  ([#373](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/373)).
- Fixed bug where `<mwc-drawer>` did not work in IE
  ([WICG/inert#129](https://github.com/WICG/inert/pull/129)).
- Fixed `dense` and `prominent` styling bugs in `<mwc-top-app-bar>`
  ([#379](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components/pull/379)).
