<!-- [TOC] -->

This roadmap describes current, future, and past goals for Material Web
Components.

<!--#include file="../googlers/roadmap.md" -->

## Current

**MWC is currently in maintenance mode,
[see this announcement](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/5642)
for more details.**

There is no current work planned for new features or components. Bug fixes or
other contributions may be added on a case-by-case basis.

## Future

**Note: No future work is planned while MWC is in
[maintenance mode](https://github.com/material-components/material-web/discussions/5642).**
These roadmap items represent what used to be planned.

### New components

These are components we have not built yet.

*   Autocomplete
*   Badge
*   Banner
*   Bottom app bar
*   Bottom sheet
*   Card
*   Data table
*   Date picker
*   Navigation bar
*   Navigation drawer
*   Navigation rail
*   Search
*   Segmented button
*   Snackbar
*   Time picker
*   Top app bar
*   Tooltip

### Expand Material Design tokens

We are adding shape and motion system tokens to support building expressive
Material experiences.

We also want to make it easier to use Material Design tokens, such as applying
Material typescale, shape, and color to your own components.

### Density and spacing tokens

Density allows components to take up less vertical space for larger displays.
While we have some spacing tokens already, we need a comprehensive spacing
system to fully support density across components.

### Create TSX components

[TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) is a popular
language extension for frameworks like [React](https://reactjs.org/). We want to
make it easier and more seamless to use Material Web Components in TSX.

### Explore Material Design layouts

Components are only part of the story to build fully expressive Material Design
applications. We want to explore ways to support building applications that
follow
[Material's layout patterns](https://m3.material.io/foundations/layout/understanding-layout/overview).

## Past

### Follow accessibility best practices

*Completed in Q1 2024*

Everyone should be able to access and enjoy the web. We want our components to
help others build accessible experiences. The following screen readers are fully
supported:

*   VoiceOver
*   Talkback
*   ChromeVox
*   JAWS
*   NVDA
